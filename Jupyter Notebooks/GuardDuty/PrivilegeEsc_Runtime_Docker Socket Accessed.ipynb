# Alerting and Detection Strategy (ADS) for GuardDuty Alert: PrivilegeEscalation:Runtime/DockerSocketAccessed
## Goal
Detect unauthorized or suspicious access to the Docker socket, which could lead to privilege escalation.
## Categorization
MITRE ATT&CK: Privilege Escalation
## Strategy Abstract
This ADS uses AWS GuardDuty alerts and Athena queries to detect unauthorized Docker socket access. It also includes Python code for automated responses.
## Technical Context
AWS GuardDuty generates alerts for suspicious activities. Athena queries can further filter these alerts. Python code can automate responses.
## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Assumes GuardDuty and CloudTrail are properly configured. May not detect activities that bypass these services.
## False Positives
Administrative activities that require Docker socket access.
## Validation
Trigger a GuardDuty alert by accessing the Docker socket in a test environment.
## Priority
High
## Response
Isolate affected instance, investigate the root cause, and apply necessary patches.
## Additional Resources
AWS GuardDuty Documentation, AWS Athena Documentation
## Investigation
### Athena Queries
#### Query: Identify Docker Socket Access Events
```sql
SELECT eventTime, eventName, instanceId, sourceIPAddress
FROM guardduty_logs
WHERE title = 'PrivilegeEscalation:Runtime/DockerSocketAccessed'
AND severity >= 7
ORDER BY eventTime DESC;
```
## Containment
### Python Code for Automated Response
```python
import boto3
def isolate_affected_instance(instance_id):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    # Modify Security Groups to an isolation group with no inbound or outbound rules
    try:
        ec2.modify_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, Groups=['sg-isolation-group-id'])
        print(f'Successfully modified security group for instance {instance_id} to isolation group.')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error modifying security group: {e}')
```
## Recovery
### Steps
1. Monitor the systems for signs of weaknesses.
2. Restore the EC2 instance from a known good backup.
3. Conduct a vulnerability assessment to ensure that the issue has been resolved.
## Lessons Learned
### Steps
1. Update incident response procedures and playbooks.
2. Conduct a retrospective of the incident.
3. Update training materials and conduct training sessions for the incident response team.
